# Secret Communication Tool
### Overview
This tool allows you to send personal messages and information with privacy by encrypting and decrypting the text.

* **Encryption:** Translates plain text into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the decryption key.

* **Decryption:** Converts ciphertext back into plaintext using the correct key.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system and the following modules:

1. Tkinter: For the graphical user interface.
2. Base64: For encryption and decryption.

To install the modules, run:

```
pip install tk
pip install base64
```
How It Works
Enter your message in the provided text area.
Provide a key for encryption or decryption.
Use the Encrypt button to encode your message.
Use the Decrypt button to decode a previously encrypted message.
